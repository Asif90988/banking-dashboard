# Current Development Context - SVP Dashboard Implementation

## Last Session Summary
- **Working on**: SVP Dashboard for Vinod Kumar (VP Regulatory Compliance)
- **Status**: Implementation phase - building drill-down from Alex's executive dashboard
- **Approach**: Hybrid architecture combining comprehensive analytics with practical management focus

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine other AI's hierarchical architecture with practical SVP management needs
2. **Build on Existing System**: Extend current login/dashboard rather than rebuild from scratch
3. **Focus Areas**: Team management, project portfolio, compliance tracking, budget analytics
4. **Navigation**: Drill-down from Alex's dashboard + direct SVP login capability

## Current Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Navigation ✅ NEXT
- Extend existing login system to support SVP roles
- Create `/svp/[id]` routing structure
- Add drill-down capability from Alex's SVP performance cards
- Create base SVP dashboard layout

### Phase 2: Team Management Dashboard
- VP performance cards with drill-down capability
- Team workload distribution visualization
- Individual team member performance tracking
- Resource allocation tools

### Phase 3: Project Portfolio Management
- Project grid with filtering and sorting
- Resource allocation tracking across projects
- Project risk assessment integration
- Timeline/Gantt view for project scheduling

### Phase 4: Compliance & Analytics
- Regulatory calendar and compliance tracking
- Advanced analytics integration
- Real-time compliance monitoring
- Budget forecasting and variance analysis

## Technical Architecture

### Current System Structure
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL database
- **Real-time**: WebSocket integration, Kafka-like streaming
- **AI**: Predictive analytics, anomaly detection, ARIA assistant

### SVP Dashboard Structure
```
/frontend/app/svp/[id]/
├── page.tsx                 # Main SVP dashboard
├── team/page.tsx           # Team management view
├── projects/page.tsx       # Project portfolio
├── budget/page.tsx         # Budget analytics
└── compliance/page.tsx     # Compliance tracking
```

### Data Flow
1. User clicks SVP card in Alex's dashboard OR logs in as SVP
2. Route to `/svp/vinod` with personalized data scope
3. Load SVP-specific data (team, projects, budget, compliance)
4. Render role-appropriate dashboard with drill-down capabilities

## Files to Review for Context
- `PROJECT_STATUS_REPORT.md` - Complete project overview
- `frontend/app/login/page.tsx` - Current login system with executives
- `frontend/app/page.tsx` - Alex's executive dashboard
- `backend/routes/dashboard.js` - Current API endpoints

## Vinod's Profile

- **Title**: VP Regulatory Compliance  
- **Department**: Compliance & Risk
- **Team Size**: ~15-20 people
